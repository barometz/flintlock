flintlock
=========

**note** Flint, and by extension Flintlock, is not maintained in this repository at this point, or anywhere else as far as I know.  For alternatives, look to https://github.com/Keboo/PebbleSharp and associated products (maybe) or other newer projects.

Flintlock is a Windows application that interacts with Pebble smartwatches using the flint library.  So 
far only tested with Windows 7 32-bit, but anything from 2000 and up is expected to work.

Binaries can be had at http://barometz.github.com/flintlock/ under "Releases" - after pairing your Pebble with your 
computer everything should work pretty much automagically, although no guarantees are made.  Some strange behaviour 
is currently expected after a failed reconnection attempt, this can be reset by scanning again or restarting the 
application.
